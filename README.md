#### Classic Algorithms

This is the implementation of classic algorithms, such as sorting algorithms.

For remembering and reviewing.

1. **Selection Sort**: uses $\sim N^2/2$ compares and $N$ exchanges.

2. **Insertion Sort**: uses $\sim N^2/4$ compares and $\sim N^2 / 4$ exchanges on average.

   For partially-sorted array, insertion sort runs in linear time.

3. **Shell Sort**: 3x+1 - 1, 4, 13, 40, .... Worse time complexity is $O(N^{3/2})$, no more than $2.5NlogN$.

4. **Knuth Shuffle**: In iteration, pick integer `r` between `0` and `i` uniformly at random and then swap `a[i]` and `a[r]`.
